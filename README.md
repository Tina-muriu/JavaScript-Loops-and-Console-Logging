# JavaScript-Loops-and-Console-Logging
**HTML Structure:**

This is a standard HTML document structure.
It includes the necessary HTML, head, and body tags.
**JavaScript Code:**
JavaScript is included within the <script> tags.
The window.onload event ensures that the JavaScript code executes when the page has fully loaded.**
**Variables:**
A variable text is declared and initialized as an empty string.
An array named myArray is declared to store three string values.
**For Loop:**
A for loop is used to iterate through the elements of myArray.
In each iteration, the current array element is logged to the console.
The array elements are also concatenated to the text variable with a newline character.
**Console Logging:**
The concatenated text is logged to the console after the loop.**
**While Loop:**
A while loop is used to count from 0 to 9 (i.e., until i is less than 10).
In each iteration, a message with the current value of i is appended to the text variable.
**Final Console Logging:**
The updated text variable, now containing both the array elements and the numbers from the while loop, is logged to the console.
**HTML Content:**
The HTML <p> element contains the text "I am so excited."
